== Roadmap

It’s not dead yet Jim! In fact, there are future plans.
See "Issues" for planned future enhancements.
When they are done, I'll release a 0.1.0-version, and will think about the next milestone.


IMPORTANT: This project is currently in Beta status - expect break in both configuration and flags -> I'm happy to take issues and improvement suggestions - about documentation, code, system flow or something else. Just keep-it-simple.:)
This app takes no responsibility for data-loss. Use "as-is". Make sure that tokens you use have *limited write access* - dont give them root-like permissions - but that is what you always do,right.
With that said, a health best effort is done to test the application with unit/integration tests and real life tests.
