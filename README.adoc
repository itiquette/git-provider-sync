== What can this tool do for you?

Git Provider Sync is a CLI tool that helps you:

1. **Mirror Repositories**: Copy your repos between different Git providers.
2. **Batch Clone Repositories**: Grab multiple repos and save them where you want.
3. **Archive Repositories**: Pack your repos into compressed files for safekeeping.

== Where can you use it?

Initially with support for these Git providers:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Gitea

And you can save your work to:

* Any of the above Git providers
* A compressed archive file (tar.gz)
* A directory on your computer

== Getting Started

2. The link:INSTALL.adoc[Installation Guide] will get you up and running.

== A friendly reminder

**Please Note**: Git Provider Sync is currently in Alpha. This means:

* Things might change in breaking ways.
* Feel free to share ideas on how we can make it better.
* When using Git Provider Sync, it's a good idea to:
  * Use tokens with limited write access (never give full permissions).
  * Keep backups of important data, just in case.

Git Provider Sync is slowly getting stable and reliable.
But as with any tool, it's always good to be careful!
