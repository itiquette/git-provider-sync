== Roadmap

It’s not dead yet Jim! In fact, there are future plans. See "Issues".

- ui: improve logging output
- ui: improve config printout
- ci: Add tags and changelog handling
- chore: Improve unit tests and docs
- feat: per target settings (force-push, ssh url etc)
- feat: per repo settings (force-push, ssh url etc)
- fix: use more provider lib features
- feat: Add additional providers, including support for custom
- feat: Add parallelism where it might hurt running in sequential mode (clone). But K-I-S-S is the leading guide here.
- external: Fix and/or report few known bugs in the eco system regarding Git Provider Sync, which would improve this app. 

IMPORTANT: This project is currently in Beta status -> I'm happy to take issues and improvement suggestions - about documentation, code, system flow or something else. Just keep-it-simple.:)
This app takes no responsibility for data-loss. Use "as-is". Make sure that tokens you use have *limited write access* - dont give them root-like permissions - but that is what you always do,right.
With that said, a health best effort is done to test the application with unit/integration tests and real life tests.
