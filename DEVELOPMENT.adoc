=== Installing Developer Tools

You have two options for installing the additional developer tools:

.Option 1: Run the helper install script
[source,console]
----
./scripts/installdevprereq.sh
----

.Option 2: Use the Make target
[source,console]
----
make install/prereq
----

== Development Workflow

=== Make Targets

We use Make to automate various development tasks. To see all available targets:

[source,console]
----
make help
----

[NOTE]
====
* Make targets are hierarchical. For example, `make quality` runs all quality checks, while `make quality/license` only runs the license check.
* For detailed information on each target, refer to the link:Makefile[Makefile].
====

=== Running Tests

Our tests are written in Go's idiomatic table-driven style.

.Run all tests
[source,console]
----
make test
----

.Run tests with coverage
[source,console]
----
make test/cover
----

== Code Quality Assurance

=== Local Quality Checks

Before submitting a Pull Request, it's crucial to run the quality checks locally:

[source,console]
----
make quality
----

TIP: If a check fails, you can run individual checks (e.g., `make quality/lint`) to pinpoint and address specific issues.

=== Quality Check Tools

==== Linting
* https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter[MegaLinter]: A comprehensive suite of linting tools
** Covers BASH, Markdown, YAML, GitHub Actions, and security scans
* https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[golangci-lint]: Go-specific linters
** Configuration: link:.golangci.yml[.golangci.yml]

==== License Compliance
* https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool[REUSE]: Ensures proper licensing and copyright notices

==== Commit Structure
* https://github.com/siderolabs/conform[Conform]: Checks commit message format

==== Go-specific Checks
* Standard Go tests
* Additional tools: `go vet`, `staticcheck`, `go mod tidy`, `govulncheck`

=== Interpreting Quality Check Results

If any checks fail, follow these steps:

1. Run individual checks to isolate the issue (e.g., `make quality/lint`)
2. Carefully review the error messages in your terminal output
3. Consult the documentation for the specific tool that reported the error
4. Address the issues and re-run the checks
5. For CI pipeline failures, reproduce the issue locally, fix it, and update your Pull Request
