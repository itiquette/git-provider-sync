* OpenSSF best practices compliance

.2. Reliability
* Error handling for sync operations
* Validation of sync states
* Support for retries

.3. Maintainability
* Modular provider system
* Comprehensive testing

=== 1.3 Stakeholders

* Developers using multiple git providers
* Organizations needing repository mirroring
* DevOps teams managing git infrastructure
* Open source contributors

== 2. Architecture Constraints

=== 2.1 Technical Constraints

* Go version 1.26+
* Git 2.43+
* Provider-specific API limitations
* Rate limiting considerations

=== 2.2 Organizational Constraints

* EUPL 1.2 License compliance
* REUSE specification compliance
* Conventional Commits standard
* Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) requirement

== 3. System Scope and Context

=== 3.1 Business Context

The system operates in an environment where there is a need to maintain repository synchronization across Git providers.
This could be for various reasons:

.1. Backup and Redundancy
* Maintaining copies of repositories across different providers
* Creating local backups for disaster recovery
* Archiving repositories for compliance

.2. Migration Support
* Facilitating provider transitions
* Supporting multi-provider strategies
* Enabling gradual migrations

.3. Cross-Platform Development
* Supporting development across different Git platforms
* Maintaining mirrors for different user groups
* Enabling platform-specific features while maintaining synchronization

The context diagram above illustrates the key interactions between the system and its environment.

=== 3.2 Technical Context

The system has support for interacting with various external systems through different interfaces:

.1. Git Provider APIs
[source,yaml]
----
GitHub API:
  - Example Base URL: api.github.com
  - Version: v3
  - Auth: OAuth tokens
  
GitLab API:
  - Example Base URL: gitlab.com/api
  - Version: v4
  - Auth: Personal access tokens
  
Gitea API:
  - Example Base URL: <instance>/api
  - Version: v1
  - Auth: Access tokens
----

.2. Authentication Methods
[source,yaml]
----
HTTP:
  - Token-based authentication
  - Rate limit considerations
  - API-specific headers

SSH:
  - Key-based authentication
  - SSH Command support
  - Custom SSH configurations
----

== 4. Solution Strategy

.Key architectural decisions:

.1. Provider Abstraction
* Modular
* Common interface for different git providers
* Extensible for new providers

.2. Configuration Management
* Hierarchical configuration system
* Multiple configuration sources
* Environment variable support

.3. Sync Process
* State-based synchronization
* Validation steps
* Error handling and retry mechanisms

.4. Security
* Token-based authentication
* Limited scope access

== 5. Building Block View

=== 6.1 High-Level Process Overview

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "Git Provider A" as GH
participant "Sync Service" as Sync
participant "Git Provider B" as GL

loop Periodic Sync
    Sync -> GH: Fetch repository state
    GH --> Sync: Return changes
    Sync -> GL: Mirror updates
    GL --> Sync: Confirm sync
end
@enduml

endif::[]

The sequence diagram above illustrates the core synchronization process at its highest level:

.1. Periodic Sync Loop
* The process runs either on schedule or manual trigger
* Each iteration handles the complete sync cycle

.2. Core Interactions
* Fetch: Get current state and changes from source provider
* Process: Handle the returned changes internally
* Mirror: Push updates to target provider
* Verify: Confirm successful synchronization

.3. Communication Pattern
* Synchronous request-response pattern
* Provider-agnostic interface
